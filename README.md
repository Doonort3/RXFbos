The mini-computer in the console can create files, delete files, modify files, run a shell, check network connectivity, and much more!
=====================

## User's manual:

To start the mini pc correctly, you need to run several commands from the directory with the files:

`$ chmod + x systemcheck.sh` (To check files)

`$ chmod + x main.sh` (Main Menu)

`$ chmod + x IIS.sh` (For initial setup)

`$ chmod + x Scripthelper.sh` (To restart the script)

#### Run systemcheck.sh:

`$ ./systemcheck.sh`

Next, you will see a message stating that a virtual disk has not been created, you will immediately be prompted to create it, `press 1`, enter the name, there is a condition, the name of the disk should start in "disk".

##### If you did everything correctly, you will see a notification about it.

Restart the script

`$ ./systemcheck.sh`

Now you have a disk where the files that you will create on the mini pc will be stored.
##### Press enter as prompted by the script.
And then you will be greeted with a message: enter the username that you will use for your home directory, select the drive where the home directory will be installed and finally enter the username :) 
Now you can enjoy your newly baked mini pc!
